EU Macroeconometrics Project
This project explores the relationship between fiscal deficits, unemployment, inflation, and GDP growth across five EU countries (2014–2024): Poland, Germany, France, Czech Republic, and Lithuania.

Objective:
To determine if these economic indicators significantly affect GDP growth over time, using real data and regression models.

Data & Methodology:

Data sourced from Eurostat

Cleaned and structured using Excel

Used Gretl for regression analysis

Model:
GDP_Growth = α + β₁(Fiscal_Deficit) + β₂(Unemployment_Rate) + β₃(Inflation_Rate) + β₄(Government_Expenditure) + error

Key Insights:

Poland: Strong link between fiscal deficits and growth (R² = 67%)

Germany: Inflation helped explain growth (R² = 54%)

France: Unemployment had the biggest negative effect (R² = 29%)

Czech Republic: Low unemployment, but negative impact from government spending

Lithuania: Strong post-COVID growth but high inflation

This project helped me understand how macroeconomic data can be modeled and interpreted across different countries and policy environments.
