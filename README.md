EU Macroeconometrics Project:

This project examines how fiscal deficits, unemployment, inflation, and government spending influence GDP growth across five EU countries—Poland, Germany, France, Czech Republic, and Lithuania—from 2014 to 2024.

Objective:

To understand whether key macroeconomic indicators have a significant impact on GDP growth over time using real-world data and regression analysis.

Data & Methodology
	•	Data sourced from Eurostat
	•	Cleaned and prepared in Excel
	•	Analyzed using Gretl through a multiple linear regression model:

Model:
GDP_Growth = α + β₁(Fiscal_Deficit) + β₂(Unemployment_Rate) + β₃(Inflation_Rate) + β₄(Government_Expenditure) + error

Key Insights
	•	Poland: Fiscal deficit showed the strongest impact on growth (R² = 67%)
	•	Germany: Inflation was the most influential variable (R² = 54%)
	•	France: Unemployment had the greatest negative effect (R² = 29%)
	•	Czech Republic: Despite low unemployment, government spending had a negative impact
	•	Lithuania: Post-COVID growth was strong but accompanied by high inflation

What I Learned:

This project deepened my understanding of how macroeconomic indicators interact and how econometric models can uncover meaningful trends across different countries and policy settings.
